## üìã Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Major CSS differences between environments
**Solution:** Upload complete localhost `ergon.css` to Hostinger (localhost version is more advanced)

### Issue: Missing header component on localhost
**Solution:** Hostinger has header component that localhost lacks - decide which approach to keep

**Solution:** Standardize on one layout approach (recommend localhost structure)

### Issue: Missing enhanced features on Hostinger
**Solution:** Upload files with:
- Enhanced KPI cards
- Dark theme support
- Better mobile responsiveness

- Notification center

### Issue: Sidebar jumping when scrolling
**Solution:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Applied recommended changes:
- Removed `transform: translateX(2px)` from hover state

- Optimized transitions to `background 0.2s ease, color 0.2s ease`
- Upload updated `ergon.css` with these fixes
